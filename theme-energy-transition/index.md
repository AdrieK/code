## ðŸ‘¥ Pair Programming

Did you decide to work through this assignment in pair programming? Brilliant! Pair programming is an excellent opportunity to exchange end strengthen your knowledge.

* We suggest switching role for each Task, as the code gets executed and marks a clear transition.
* As you take the driver seat, remember to think aloud and ask questions to the navigator
* As you take on the navigator seat, help the driver answering his question. If you spot an error, let the driver finish his/her flow before communicating them

Remember that it is an exercise of courage, continuously admitting when you do not know. This way, the other get the opportunity to explain and, through this process, check whether they have themselves a clear understanding of the concept at hand.

Working at a distance adds a layer of complexity. With _Replit_, one person in the pair creates a project. Then, using the `share` button on the top right corner, you share an 'editable' link with your pair, which you can both edit.

We suggest using a communication tool such as MS Team to open a video channel, staying in constant video and voice interaction during the duration of the pair programming

Share your experience on Discourse with the tag `pair-programming`


## ðŸ”— Git and GitHub

Do you want to explore the Git/GitHub workflow? You need to create a free GitHub account if you do not have one yet. This flow works regardless of working solo or in pair.

Create a repository with an initial README.md file, then access this repository from _Replit_.

![GitHub create repository - Replit]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/git.gif)

We suggest:

* creating a commit and pushing on your GitHub repository at the end of each Task;
* creating a branch at the beginning of each step and merge it in the Master at the end of each step.
