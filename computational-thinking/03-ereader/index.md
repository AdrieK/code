# 03 eReader

In this third Python programming assignment, you build an eReader with two functionalities: loading an eBook in the Terminal and enabling the user to 'turn the page'. This exercise reveals the need for `loops` to repeat the code. Then, you wrap (or encapsulate) into a reusable `function`. Finally, you experience the three steps of computational thinking: decomposition, recognition and algorithm design.

Through this assignment, we explore the following concepts:

Function
{: .label .label-green }

Encapsulation
{: .label .label-green }

While-Loop
{: .label .label-green }

For-Loop
{: .label .label-green }

String
{: .label .label-blue }

Object
{: .label .label-blue }

File
{: .label .label-red }

Flow chart
{: .label .label-yellow }

Assertion
{: .label .label-yellow }

## üí®  Brief Refresher

Let's start with a brief refresher of the topics we covered in previous assignments that might be useful to remember.

* **Flow Chart** -- A flow chart is particularly suitable as it represents a sequence of steps and decisions. When thinking or communicating about your algorithm, you might find it easier to start with such a flow chart. We read a flow chart from _start_ to _end_ in oval/rounded shapes. Each shape connects to another via an arrow, and rectangles representd a process (i.e. an action to perform).

* **File** -- A file is a common way to structure long-term memory. You certainly use files to store pictures and other documents. A file is characterised by a path (where to find it), a type of content (e.g. text, picture, video) and a size.
