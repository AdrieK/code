# Refresher
{: .no_toc }

Here is a quick refresher of the topics that were covered in previous assignments that might be useful to remember before starting the next assignment. 
Feel free to skip this refresher and start with step 1.

## What is a Flow Chart?
Along with plain English, it is often helpful to make a graphical representation of our algorithm. A flow chart is particularly suitable as it represents a sequence of steps and decisions. When thinking or communicating about your algorithm, you might find it easier to start with such a flow chart.

Let's see how the _Calculator Algorithm_ could look like:

We read a flow chart from _start_ to _end_ in oval/rounded shapes. Each shape is connected to another via an arrow and rectangles represent a process (i.e. an action to perform). As our algorithms get more complicated throughout the assignments, we will introduce a few more shapes in due time.

## What is a File?
A file is a common way to structure long-term memory. You certainly use files to store pictures and other documents. A file is characterised by a path (where to find it), a type of content (e.g. text, picture, video) and a size.

In the previous assignment we covered writing text to a file, and how to read text from a file.
