# 01 Calculator

This first Python programming assignment leads you through the design of your first algorithm to mimic a calculator, adding two numbers provided by the user. Through this example, we introduce the concept of `variables` and `data types`. We also explore `inputs` and `outputs` to receive information from the users and respond to them. Finally, we discuss how to investigate (or debug) the code when the result is not as expected.
