# 04 Generative Art

In this fourth Python programming assignment, you move the user interaction from the Terminal to the web browser. You organise the code in several files, and you import `modules` to rely on code from other developers. Finally, you create an algorithm that generates random Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) that you expose on the web.

Through this assignment, we explore the following concepts:

While-Loop
{: .label .label-green }

For-Loop
{: .label .label-green }

String
{: .label .label-blue }

web endpoint
{: .label .label-red }

SVG
{: .label .label-red }

Modules
{: .label .label-yellow }

Flask
{: .label .label-purple }

## üí®  Brief Refresher

Let's start with a brief refresher of the topics we covered in previous assignments that might be useful to remember.

* **While-Loop** -- a structure that repeats a block of code _while_ a condition is `true`. It involves an `initialisation code`, a `condition` to continue iterating as long as it is `true` and the 
`Change code` which modify the condition.

```python
# initialisation code
while (condition):
    # change code
```

* **For-Loop** -- a structure that makes the boundaries of the loop explicit. In contrast with the while-loop, we recommend for-loop when we know how many iterations are needed. This time we define a variable as part of the structure, often named `i` for 'index', which keeps track of the iteration number. `start`, `finish`, and `change` define the number of iterations.

```python
for i in range(start, finish, change):
    # action
```

* **Function** -- a block of code that performs an `action`, identified by a `name`. A function defines a set of actions that we can call in a single line, everywhere in the code. It receives information through `parameters` and returns a result. We use the name to `call` it, i.e. running the associated code block (e.g. `print()`). When calling a function, we provide the values (or arguments) necessary for each function's parameter. So, functions are handy because it avoids duplicating code, making the development more efficient and robust.

```python
def name(parameter1, parameter2):
    """This is an example of function definition.
    parameter1 -- a first example parameter
    parameter2 -- a second example parameter
    """

    # Action

    return result
```
