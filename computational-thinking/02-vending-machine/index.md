# 02 Hot Beverage Vending Machine

How would you shape the behaviour of your favourite vending machine? In this second Python programming assignment, you will prototype some logics with `branches` and `operators` to drive through alternative paths in your program. This will shape the behaviour of a hot beverage vending machine depending on the user choices. You will also use `files` to store and retrieve available supply such as the number of remaining cups or the amount of sugar.
