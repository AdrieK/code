# Goal



# Approach

The language and the environment might scare you out. In these assignments, we will aim at breaking this to give you the confidence to go further.

Everything is self-paced. A day of coding will fit for some of you. However, I recommend you to start making your own choice. A couple of hours per day works better? Go for it, try and see what works for you.

Everyone is going to learn at a different pace. For this, instead of an 8-hour assignment weekly assignment, we packaged this introduction to programming into small blocks of self-paced code practice to fit the different learning pace.

Short videos, written tutorials and automated testing to fit the different learning styles. For some of you, the videos will sound too slow, for some of you, even some assignment might not go as fast as you would like.

We have marked each coding exercise to give you an indication, from fundamental (what we expect everyone to achieve) to intermediate (what we expect everyone to try) and advanced (for those who can't wait to learn more).

# Language

We choose Python as a language, an overarching choice of TU Delft and many other institutions around the world as it enables a gradual immersion into coding. However, it is not about learning a syntax but getting into the software engineers habits.

We will always start with algorithms, to think first about what we want to do. Once you know what you want to do, it is much easier to Google for the Python syntax or any other language syntax.

An important disclaimer, you will not be a programmer by the end of this course. This might come as a disillusion for some of you, maybe a release for others. We are not going to cover in 64 hours what a computer science student achieves in several fulltime years.

We want you to be comfortable reading a piece of code and using small pieces to tinker with the digital world, as you do for the physical one through materials, manufacturing and so on.
You have a question about the code practice.

# Support

Beyond the videos and tutorials, automated testing of your code or expected results from the tutorials should help you assess your progress.

Googling your question, you will soon recognise one particular platform: Stack Overflow. Similar to Quora, this is a popular platform for programmers to ask questions and upvote the best answer. You might find your solution over there. However, you might feel intimidated or simply not understanding the jargon of the answer. We are here to help! This is why we have set up a similar environment.

When something is not working as expected, that you do not understand how to move forward, please look at the course Q/A platform for questions related to the code practice you are working on.

We encourage you not only to ask questions, but answer the one you feel like, from other students. Please upvote a question that you have as well, and the answer that helped you.

See our template to ask questions that provide enough information for us and other students to help you effectively.

Last piece of advice: type in the code from the tutorials instead of copying and pasting. For many of you this will slow you down but help you identify patterns of code coming over and over again.

It is going to be a challenging journey. Learning how to code requires dedication and perseverance. However, I believe it will be rewarding for all of you.
