# Shared Pomodoro

In the seventh Python programming assignment, you develop the state-machine algorithm of a Pomodoro time-tracker. You make your web application more dynamic with WebSocket and let your Python programme run several parallel processes using `threads`.

Through this assignment, we explore the following concepts:

Thread
{: .label .label-green }

Web Socket
{: .label .label-red }

State Machine
{: .label .label-yellow }

## Acknowledgement

Thanks [Aadjan van der Helm](mailto:A.J.C.vanderHelm@tudelft.nl) who inspired this assignment, and [Doreen Mulder](mailto:D.Mulder@student.tudelft.nl) who shared the code that we adapted for this assignment.

## ‚è∞  Time Management and Expectations

This assignment aims at 8 hours. However, it is easy to spend more time on each step. Keep in mind the following indications. It is crucial to practice your computational thinking by implementing the state machine's logic (Steps 2 and 4). We encourage you to copy and paste in Step 3 because setting up a web page is not the focus of this assignment.

* ‚úÖ (1hr) Step 1 (class) revisits elements already covered through a class definition. It also introduces the concept of handlers;
* ‚ö†Ô∏è (2.5hr) Step 2 (states) is a critical step of this assignment, defining part of your state machine;
* üèó (1hrs) Step 3 (WebSocket) setups the web server;
* ‚ö†Ô∏è(2.5hr) Step 4 (States) is a critical step of this assignment, finalising the definition of your state machine;
* ‚úÖ (1hrs) Step 5 (WebSocket) uses WebSocket to send updates to clients;
