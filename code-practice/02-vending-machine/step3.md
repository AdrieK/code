In the first code practice, we used the `+`, an arithmetic operator that can be used the same way as the mathematic symbol. However, we debugged our programme, realising that we can also 'add' two String (i.e. text, a sequence of characters) together, the so-called concatenation. Thus, operators can behave differently depending on the type of variables.

In this step, we will explore other types of operators such as comparison, logical and assignment to extend the capabilities of the vending machine algorithm. 

For a complete list, you can refer to the W3Schools for a complete [list of operators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp)

# Task 3.1 Shame greedy users



# Task 3.2 

In the previous step, we used the `==` operator to check if the user input is equal to a specific choice of hot beverage.


There are several other operators `>=` `<=`, `!=`

# Task 3.3 Count remaining cups

We encountered the assignment operator `=` in the 

Assignment

`-=`




Logical operators
