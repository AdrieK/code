We covered a lot of ground through the construction of this vending machine algorithm.

With the ability to save data into files and the endless combination of operators and condition, you can now design and implement your Vending Machine algorithm.

# Extra Task 6.1 Write your algorithm

# Extra Task 6.2 Draw a flow chart

# Extra Task 6.3 Write the Python code

Go ahead and share your Vending Machine algorithm on Discourse! Make sure to provide a title and a short description that capture what makes it YOUR algorithm.
