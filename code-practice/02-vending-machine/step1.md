We can start developing our hot beverage algorithm with the elements we used in the first code practice. For example:

Hot beverage algorithm 1
Tell the user ‘Welcome to IO1075 Hot Beverage service!’
Tell the user ‘Here is what we offer:’
Tell the user ‘1) Coffee’
Tell the user ‘2) Tea’

Create a variable called choice of type number with the initial value 0
Ask the user ‘Type in your choice: ’ and store the answer in choice
Tell the user "Here is your " choice
Tell the user "Have a great day!"

## Task 1.1: Create a new Replit project and write the Hot beverage algorithm 1 as comments.

## Task 1.2: For each comment, write the Python code.

## Task 1.3: Execute the code.

[TODO GIF OF HOW IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE]

There are a few things that we can work on (or many), but let’s focus on the choices: in this code practice we will ask more information depending on the user’s choice
