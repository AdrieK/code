For the computer to learn, it needs the ability to memorise information. This is the role of the variables. In programming, a variable is a storage location in the computer memory, paired with a name. This name will enable us to retrieve the information to use in our programme.

To create a new variable, we need three elements:
* _name_: what do we call this thing that we want the computer to remember?
* _type_: what type of data does it contain?
* _initVal_: What is it's starting value?

So here is our first algorithm that teaches the computer how to remember information:

_Create a variable called name of type type that starts with the value initVal_
{: .fs-5 .ls-10 .code-example }

Now that we know what we want to do, it is a matter of finding the Python syntax. It looks like this:

```python
name = initVal
```

>**Note:** Unlike in mathematics in which the equal sign ‘=’ means that the expressions on both sides are equal, in programming ‘=’ means that the right part is ‘assigned’ to the left part.

## Task 2.1: Write the algorithm

In the text editor, we can thus type in the following two lines for our algorithm:

```python
# Create a variable called x of type number that starters with the value 0
# Create a variable called y of type number that starters with the value 0
# Create a variable called sum of type number that starters with the value 0
```

The hashtag ‘#’ at the start of the line means that it is a comment: plain English explanation of what you want to do.

## Task 2.2: Write the code

In the text editor, for each comment, type in the Python code which explains the comments to the computer.

You should obtain something like this:

```python
# Create a variable called x of type number that starters with the value 0
x = 0
# Create a variable called y of type number that starters with the value 0
y = 0
# Create a variable called sum of type number that starters with the value 0
sum = 0
```

## Task 2.3: Execute the code

Ask the computer to execute your instruction by clicking on the green arrow at the top of the page.

Nothing happens. Indeed, we are storing zeros in three variables, without asking the computer to show anything.
