Failure is wonderful

This is a normal part of programming

Begin debugging now

Did you tell it what to do incorrectly?

Or did you tell it to do the wrong thing?


How to debug

Easy to assume the + sign is broken
That's not really the problem

Try 

```python
print("python" + "meetup")
```

Hmmm. We can add text?

Yes, it's called concatenation

I wonder if it thinks "2" and "3" are text?

We look up a tool to find out, type function does this!


Convert to integer

* _oldVariable_: in a non-integer format
* _intVariable_: integer to hold results

Convert to integer algorithm

_Convert oldVariable to integer and store in intVariable_
{: .fs-5 .ls-10 .code-example }

```python
intVariable = int(oldVariable)
```

OK, let's start fresh, bring back only the comments without code

```
# Add convert x to integer
# Add convert y to integer
```
