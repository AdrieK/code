# #01 User Interaction

In this first code practice, we will teach the computer how to interact with us to sum two numbers. That is what programming is about: telling the computer what to do.

For this, we need to know what it should do. This is the algorithm, a sequence of well-defined instructions. Throughout the code practice, we will write algorithms in plain English, to make sure that we know what we want the computer to do. Then, writing the code is a matter of syntax, be it Python or any other language.

Through this code practice we will explore the following concepts:

Variable
{: .label .label-green }

Input
{: .label .label-green }

Output
{: .label .label-green }

Algorithm
{: .label .label-green }

Error
{: .label .label-yellow }

Debug
{: .label .label-yellow }
