## Integrated Development Environment

Let’s open the Repl.it. Repl.it is an environment to write code, directly in your web browser. It certainly has some limitations, but in this way, we can get started right away, without installing any additional software on our laptop.

When you open Repl.it, you can see three vertical panels:
* on the left, this is a file explorer listing the file of your project. All our code will fit in the default file ‘main.py’;
* in the centre, this is a text editor, to edit the code. You can see that there is one tab at the top ‘main.py’: you are currently editing this file.
* on the right, this is a Terminal: a text-based interface to interact with the computer.

We will use both the text editor and the Terminal in the following steps.
