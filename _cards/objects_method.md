## What Are Object's Methods?

In the first assignment, we learned about `strings` as _objects_: data structures which combines one or several values. In fact, `strings` combine characters (`char` data type) as a sequence. In the second assignment, we learned about files, another object combining all the necessary values to mange access to a file. We used the file object to read from (`file.read()`), write into (`file.write()`) and close (`file.close()`) the text file.

These are `methods`: functions that act on an object. You can recognise the Python syntax of a function call with a name followed by parentheses that contain the parameters (if any required). The dot `.` is used to call the method, indicating that this is the method of a given object.

In this step we explore the concept of `method` with the `string` object. we have plenty of `string` objects at hand: each line of the book we read is a `string` that we can 'play' with. A list of `string` methods is available on [W3School website](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp)
