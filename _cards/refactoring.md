## What is Refactoring?

The second strategy to make the code more reuseable is `refactoring`. Now that the code is written, we look back at the code and make a second iteration of `computational thinking`: can some tasks be handled more effectively or with more clarity? can we identify or anticipate patterns? how does it impact the design of the algorithm? This process can be about performances, but most importantly it is about readability and maintainability. To some extent, you might consider that restructuring the code into modules (e.g. Task 2.1) is a form of refactoring.
