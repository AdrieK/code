## What is WebSocket?

WebSocket is a network protocol of the application layer (in the Internet stack) like HTTP (You know what is HTTP by now!). Web socket often used above HTTP to ensure compatibility with the web protocols. While HTTP only enables clients (e.g. web browsers) to communicate with the server, WebSocket enables a bi-directional communication. The server can push data to all connected clients in a more efficient way, whenever it needs to, without the clients having to pull for an update.
