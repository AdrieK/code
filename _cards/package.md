## What is Package?

In the previous step, we introduced `modules`. These are files with Python code that we can import and use in our code. While `modules` are files, `packages` are folders hierarchically structuring modules. You can install packages from other developers so that your code can rely on their code. `Packages` opens up whole new horizons: you are not coding everything by yourselves but reusing functions made available by others. We say that your code has 'dependencies', i.e. it depends on packages from other developers.

Installing a package means downloading a folder with subfolders and files (e.g. packages and modules) which contain functions that you can use in your code in the same way you use your modules. As each package can rely on its own set of dependencies, the installation becomes quickly complicated. No worries. `Package managers` are here to handle this process for us.
