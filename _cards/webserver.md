## What is a Web Server?

In this assignment, we want to move beyond the Terminal inputs and outputs. From this step, the output of the code will appear on a `web page`.

When you use your web browser to open a web page, you are requesting content from a network of computers. These computers are listening for requests and respond with the requested content. They _serve_ content on to _clients_ such as a web browser. We describe here the role of a `webserver`.

Serving the output of our code on a webpage has many advantages for designers. Software is increasingly accessible as web applications, and many devices can display web pages. These make web page an appropriate medium for prototyping, even though the final product or service might rely on different technologies.
