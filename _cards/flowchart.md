# Flow Chart

Along with plain English, it is often helpful to make a graphical representation of our algorithm. A flow chart is particularly suitable as it represents a sequence of steps and decisions. When thinking or communicating about your algorithm, you might find it easier to start with such a flow chart.

Let's see how the _Calculator Algorithm_ could look like:

We read a flow chart from _start_ to _end_ in oval/rounded shapes. Each shape is connected to another via an arrow and rectangles represent a process (i.e. an action to perform). As our algorithms get more complicated throughout the assignments, we will introduce a few more shapes in due time.
