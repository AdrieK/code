## What is a Variable?

For the computer to learn, it needs the ability to memorise information. This is the role of the **variables**. In programming, a variable is a storage location in the computer's memory, paired with a name. This name will enable us to retrieve the information to use in our programme.

To create a new variable, we need three elements:

* `name` what do we call this thing that we want the computer to remember?
* `type` what type of data does it contain?
* `initial value` What is it's starting value?

The computer classifies the data it handles by types. This enables it to know what is meaningful to do with this data. Here are three examples of data types:

* a variable of type `int` can keep integer numbers in memory, these are values such as `12` or `-134`
* a variable of type `float` can keep decimal numbers in memory, these are values such as `12.0` or `-134.3`
* a variable of type `char` can keep a single character in memory, these are values such as `A`, `b`, `1` or `!`

We will complete this list as we progress through the assignments.

So here is in plain English the algorithm that teaches the computer how to remember information:
