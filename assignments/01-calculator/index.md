# 01 Calculator

This first Python programming assignment leads you through the design of your first algorithm to mimic a calculator, adding two numbers provided by the user. Through this example, we introduce the concept of `variable` and `data-type` along with `input` and `output` to receive from and send to the user some information. We also discuss how to investigate (or debug) the code when the result is not as expected.
