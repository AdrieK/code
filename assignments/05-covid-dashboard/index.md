# 05 COVID Dashboard

In this fifth Python programming assignment, you continue exploring web interfaces. You request data from a web service to collect the latest COVID-19 statistics and process it while exploring time series and data formats. Based on this data, you expose a series of charts on the web, organised into a dashboard.
