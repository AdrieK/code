# 04 Generative Art

In this fourth Python programming assignment, you will move the user interaction from the Terminal to the web browser. You will organise the code in several files and rely on code from other developers by importing `modules`. You will create an algorithm that generates random Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) that you can expose on the web.
