# 08 Connected Home

At this stage, you used different Objects and their methods such as a File or a List. In the sixth Python programming assignment, you will look behind the Object and what they are into the paradigm of Object-Oriented Programming. Modelling a Home Hub and its appliances, you will explore this paradigm as a powerful abstraction mechanism.

Through this assignment, we will explore the following concepts:

OOP
{: .label .label-green }

Abstraction
{: .label .label-green }

Inheritance
{: .label .label-green }

Class
{: .label .label-green }

Property
{: .label .label-green }

Methods
{: .label .label-green }

Object
{: .label .label-blue }



Programming paradigm, a style of programming
Centred around objects rather than function

Procedural programming
Some variables, some function, 

What do we have so far:
Variable => the data
Functions => what happen

Letâ€™s brings them together
Data, functionality

The template, the mould

Modelling


Encapsulation: bringing together variables (properties) and functions (methods) in one unit.



Step: draw/model

Step: OOP concepts
We have seen that function wrap chunks of code so that we do not have to repeat them
We have seen objects such as List, which are more advanced variables with methods: a function to apply directly to this object

What about making our own objects?
