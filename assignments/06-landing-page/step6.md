## What did we cover?

You completed the sixth assignment: developed a landing page, the associated object-oriented model and the database interaction to collect pre-orders from potential customers

In these extra steps, we propose to reuse the code developed for the COVID dashboard to develop an admin dashboard for monitoring your pre-orders and customers.

# Extra Task 6.1 Design an Administration Dashboard with HTML and CSS

It takes an `admin.html` with a content similar to the COVID dashboard. You will need an HTTP route to serve this page. 

# Extra Task 6.2 Visualise Pre-Orders over Time

Use Vega to create a bar chart template, merge it with the pre-order data and visualise it as a bar chart

[Check the code on Replit](https://repl.it/@IO1075/06-landing-page-step5-4)

# Extra Task 6.3 Visualise Pre-Order Sizes and Colours

Use Vega to create a pie chart template and visualise the number of pre-orders per size or colour.
