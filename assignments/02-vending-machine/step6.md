We covered a lot of ground through the construction of this vending machine algorithm. The branches provide different alternatives to your algorithms, you can save to and retrieve from files. With this ability the endless combination of operators and condition, you can now design and implement your Vending Machine algorithm. Here are four tasks you can explore to expend your algorithm


# Extra Task 6.1 Add more Beverages

Add a number of beverages and the related conditions.

# Extra Task 6.2 Prevent Serving Beverage

heck the number of remaining cups and define behaviour when there is nothing left.

# Extra Task 6.4 No unnecessary question

Do not ask for sugar or milk if the choice of beverage is unknown.

# Extra Task 6.5 Manage Sugar and Milk

Keep track of milk and sugar consumption (like the number of cups), save it to and retrieve it from files.

Go ahead and share your Vending Machine algorithm on Discourse! Make sure to provide a title and a short description that capture what makes it YOUR algorithm.
