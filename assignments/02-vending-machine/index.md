# 02 Hot Beverage Vending Machine

How would you shape the behaviour of your favourite vending machine? In this second code assignment, you will prototype some logics with operators and conditions to drive through alternative paths in your program. This will shape the behaviour of a hot beverage vending machine depending on the user choices. You will also use files to store and retrieve available supply such as the number of remaining cups or the amount of sugar.
