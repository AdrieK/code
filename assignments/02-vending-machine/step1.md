Let's start the development of our vending machine algorithm with the elements we used in the first assignment. For instance, we need to tell the users what is available, ask them for their choice and tell them their choice.

#### Hot beverage algorithm 1

```
Tell the user ‘Welcome to IO1075 Hot Beverage service!’
Tell the user ‘Here is what we offer:’
Tell the user ‘1) Coffee’
Tell the user ‘2) Tea’

Create a variable called choice of type number with the initial value 0
Ask the user ‘Type in your choice: ’ and store the answer in choice
Tell the user "Here is your " choice
Tell the user "Have a great day!"
```

## Task 1.1: Create a project

Create a new _Replit_ project and write the _Hot beverage algorithm 1_ as comments (adding the hashtag `#` in front of each line).

## Task 1.2: Write the Python code

The next step is to write the Python code for each comment. Do not hesitate to revisit the first assignment if you forgot about the Python syntax.

## Task 1.3: Execute the code

The first version of your vending machine algorithm is ready, execute the code to check that it behaves the way you expect.

There are a few things that we can work on (or many), but let’s focus on the choices: in this assignment we will ask more information depending on the user’s choice
