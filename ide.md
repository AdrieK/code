Programming involves a series of task that software developers continuously do

It is the equivalent of the sketching and ideation set of the design enabling to quickly iterate on the design.

So what software continuously do:

* **Write code** which requires a text editor which knows the language so that it can support the developer by highlighting errors or making suggestions. MS Word does this for English, highlighting grammar error or suggesting to auto-complete the date of the day.
* **Organise code into several files**, which requires fast and structured access to files so that the developer can switch from one to another
* **Test code**, which requires a fast way to tell the computer to run the code and show the results

This is the role of an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** combining these functionalities and more in a single tool.

There are many IDEs which support one or several programming languages and the above functionalities in addition to many more. What we need to get started is an IDE that supports Python language and does not require any setup. 

Thus, we will use [Replit](https://repl.it), an IDE that you access directly from your favourite web browser. In the following video we guide you through the functionalities of Replit that you will use in this series of code assignments. We also describe each functionality in the following sections.

[TODO video hands-on guided tour]


## Sign Up

[TODO Sign up]

## Open a Project

[TODO project with existing code]

## Explore the Replit Layout

When you open a project, you can see three vertical panels:

* on the left, this is a file explorer listing the file of your project. All our code will fit in the default file ‘main.py’;
* in the centre, this is a text editor, to edit the code. You can see that there is one tab at the top ‘main.py’: you are currently editing this file.
* on the right, this is a Terminal: a text-based interface to interact with the computer.

## Execute Code

[TODO Run button and Terminal]

## Edit Code

[TODO Syntax highlighting]

## Organise Files

[TODO open files, create files/folder]


## Create a new Project

[TODO create a new project]


There are more button and functionalities on Replit, but so far this is all we need to know to get started. Let's jump in the first code assignment!
